## Job Description
The job defined in Rundeck is named "echo something" and is designed to execute a simple command that outputs the text "something" to the console. It is scheduled to run with execution enabled, and it operates under the default logging level set to INFO.

## Recommended Improvements
1. **Add Parameterization**: Allow users to pass different messages as parameters to the job instead of hardcoding the "something" string, making it more flexible and versatile.
2. **Implement Error Handling**: Introduce error checking and handling mechanisms to manage potential failures in command execution, ensuring clear notifications in case of errors.
3. **Security Improvements**: Restrict job execution to specific user roles to avoid unauthorized or unintended executions, and ensure that sensitive data is not logged in the output.
