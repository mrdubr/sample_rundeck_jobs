# Job Description (revision 1)
The job defined in the Rundeck XML configuration is a simple task that executes two commands sequentially on the specified nodes. It first echoes "Hello World" to standard output, followed by echoing "Success". The job is enabled for execution and scheduled to run, with its output logged at the INFO level.

# Changes from previous revision (revision 0)
The primary change between the original and updated Rundeck job definitions is the addition of a second command in the job's sequence section. 

**Original Job Definition:**
- The job executes a single command: `echo "Hello World"`.

**Updated Job Definition:**
- The job now includes an additional command: `echo "Success"`, meaning the job will now execute two commands in sequence:
  1. `echo "Hello World"`
  2. `echo "Success"`

This change enhances the job by allowing it to output two messages to stdout instead of just one. All other aspects of the job definition remain unchanged.
