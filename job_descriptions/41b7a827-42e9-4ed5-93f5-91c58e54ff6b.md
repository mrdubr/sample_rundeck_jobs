# Job Description (revision 9)
The job defined in the Rundeck configuration executes two sequential commands that print messages to standard output. The first command, `echo "Hello World"`, outputs "Hello World" to the console, followed by the second command, `echo "Success"`, which outputs "Success".

**Recommendation**: To enhance the security and performance of this job, consider the following improvements: 
1. **Parameterization**: Instead of hardcoding the messages into the echo commands, use job parameters to allow dynamic input. This will make the job more flexible and reusable.
2. **Logging**: Implement better logging practices by capturing the output in an execution log or using the `log` command to log messages at different log levels, which can help with debugging.
3. **Access Control**: Set up proper access controls for who can execute this job to prevent unauthorized access.
4. **Error Handling**: Introduce error handling by adding a check after each command to ensure it executed successfully and use `keepgoing='true'` to allow the job to continue running or fail gracefully.
5. **Resource Management**: Ensure the job runs on a specific node with sufficient resources to handle logging and execution tasks efficiently, optimizing node usage. Additionally, running

# Changes from previous revision (revision 8)
The main changes between the original and updated Rundeck job definitions are as follows:

1. **Job Name Change**: 
   - Original: `Dummy job that echos to stdout 5`
   - Updated: `Dummy job that echos to stdout 6`

No other changes are present in the job definition, as the execution commands and other job properties remain identical between the two versions.
