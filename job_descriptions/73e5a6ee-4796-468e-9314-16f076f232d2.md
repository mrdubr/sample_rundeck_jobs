# Job Description (revision 1)
The job titled "Echo something 2" is a simple Rundeck job that executes a single command using the `exec` directive. The command it runs is `echo "New job"`, which outputs the text "New job" to the console or log when the job is executed.

**Recommendation:**  
To improve the job's security, consider implementing user permissions to restrict access to the job based on roles. Additionally, you could use a logging mechanism that captures output to a file for auditing purposes rather than just the console. For performance, this job is lightweight, but if it were to expand, utilizing the Rundeck variable feature to parameterize the echoed message could enhance its flexibility. Lastly, consider adding error handling or validation checks to ensure that the command runs successfully before assuming it has completed, which can minimize issues in more complex job scenarios.

# Changes from previous revision (revision 0)
The changes between the original and updated Rundeck job definitions are as follows:

1. **Job Name Change**: 
   - The name of the job has been updated from "Echo something" to "Echo something 2".

No other changes were made to the configuration, including the job ID, log level, execution state, command sequence, or any other attributes. The job's execution command remains the same: `echo "New job"`.
