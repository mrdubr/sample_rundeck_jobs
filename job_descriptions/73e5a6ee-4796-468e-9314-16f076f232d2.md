# Job Description (revision 2)
The job named "Echo something 3" is designed to execute a simple command that outputs the string "New job" to the console. This job runs on all nodes as it does not have any specific node filtering enabled, and it has logging set to the INFO level.

**Recommendation:**  
To enhance the security, performance, and functionality of this job, consider the following recommendations: 
1. **Add Input Parameters:** Introduce parameters to make the output dynamic, allowing users to customize the message. This enhances usability and flexibility.
2. **Use Secure Logging:** Ensure that sensitive information isn't logged by configuring the log level appropriately, or by masking sensitive information if the job evolves to handle such data.
3. **Node Filtering:** Enable node filtering to limit job execution to specific nodes, improving performance and security by reducing the scope of execution.
4. **Error Handling:** Implement error handling or status checks to gracefully manage any issues during job execution, ensuring proper feedback in case of failures.
5. **Scheduled Execution:** If this job needs to run periodically, consider setting up a schedule with appropriate timing to automate it, while ensuring it doesnâ€™t overlap with other resource-intensive jobs.
