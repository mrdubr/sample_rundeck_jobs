# Job Description (revision 26)
The job defined in the Rundeck job specification is designed to verify network connectivity to a specified remote server by making an HTTP GET request. The remote URL is provided as a required option (`url`), and the job is configured to use a 30-second timeout and SSL verification for secure communication.

**Recommendation:**  
To improve this job's security, consider implementing authentication mechanisms instead of leaving it set to 'None'; this could involve using API tokens or basic auth as appropriate for the remote server. You might also enable logging of the response code and consider printing the response to a file for easier debugging, if the response contains useful information. For performance, ensure that the timeout is optimized according to the expected latency of your network; too long of a timeout could delay job completion unnecessarily. Finally, consider adding error handling in case the request fails, which would provide better feedback and management of the job execution.

# Changes from previous revision (revision 25)
The primary change between the original and updated Rundeck job definitions is in the **name** of the job. 

- **Original Job Name:** "Call a remote server using http to verify networking connectivity 123"
- **Updated Job Name:** "Call a remote server using http to verify networking connectivity"

All other aspects of the job definition, including options, execution settings, and command configuration, remain unchanged.
