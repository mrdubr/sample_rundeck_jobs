# Job Description (for revision 21)
This Rundeck job, named "Call a remote server to verify networking connectivity," is designed to perform a GET request to a specified remote URL, which is provided as a required option (`url`) by the user. The job executes an HTTP request using the `HttpWorkflowStepPlugin` with parameters that include a 30-second timeout and SSL verification enabled. It does not print the response or response code, making it a straightforward connectivity check without output clutter.

# Changes from previous revision (revision 20)
The key change between the two Rundeck job definitions is in the job's name.

- **Updated Job Name:** "Call a remote server to verify networking connectivity"

No other modifications were made to the job's structure, configuration, or parameters; all other elements, such as the ID, execution details, and HTTP step plugin parameters, remain identical between the two versions.
