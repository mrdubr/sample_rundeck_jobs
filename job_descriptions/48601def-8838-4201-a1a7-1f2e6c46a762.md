# Job Description (revision 24)
This Rundeck job is designed to verify networking connectivity to a remote server by making an HTTP GET request to a specified URL. The plugin uses the `HttpWorkflowStepPlugin` to perform this action with a timeout of 30 seconds and options to enable SSL verification, but it does not require authentication or print the response.

**Recommendation**: To improve this job's security and performance, consider the following enhancements: 
1. **Authentication**: If the remote server requires authentication, implement support for basic or token-based authentication to ensure only authorized access. 
2. **Response Handling**: Enable the `checkResponseCode` option and set `printResponseCode` to true to track the response codes. This would allow for better error handling and quicker diagnostics if connectivity issues arise.
3. **Timeout Configuration**: Review the default 30-second timeout to ensure it's appropriate for expected response times, adjusting as necessary based on network conditions or server responsiveness.
4. **Logging**: Enhance logging by providing a description of the response in the log output. This will help in debugging without needing to run the job multiple times.
5. **Input Validation**: Implement input validation for the `url` option to ensure it follows a proper URL format before execution

# Changes from previous revision (revision 23)
The changes between the two Rundeck job definitions are as follows:

1. **Job Name**:
   - **Original**: "Call a remote server to verify networking connectivity"
   - **Updated**: "Call a remote server using http to verify networking connectivity"
   - **Change**: The updated job name specifies the method (HTTP) being used.

2. **Removed Command**:
   - **Original**: The job includes a command with `exec` that outputs `echo "Done"` after the HTTP request.
   - **Updated**: This command has been removed in the updated definition.
   - **Change**: The updated job now only consists of the HTTP workflow step plugin command.

Overall, the main difference is the change in the job name to include "using http," and the removal of the execution command that echoes "Done." All other configurations and settings remain unchanged.
