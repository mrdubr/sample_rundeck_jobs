## Job Description
The job named "Check network connectivity by ping amazon.com" is designed to check the connectivity to the URL 'amazon.com' using an HTTP GET request. It utilizes the `HttpWorkflowNodeStepPlugin` to send this request, with no authentication required, and a timeout set for 30 seconds for the operation.

## Recommended Improvements
1. **Add Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage scenarios where the request fails or times out, possibly by checking the HTTP response and logging appropriate messages.
  
2. **Enhance Security**: While SSL verification is enabled, consider enforcing a stricter security protocol by defining a more advanced authentication method or implementing a proxy if sensitive data is involved.

3. **Optimize Performance**: Instead of a fixed timeout of 30 seconds, allow for a configurable timeout based on specific environments or expected network latencies, ensuring it doesn't lead to unnecessary delays in job execution.
